                    I started college in August 2015 with high hopes of becoming a CPA. I graduated in May 2019 and after four long months of studying and one year of work at a Big 4 public accounting firm I achieved my goal. Upon achieving my goal I realized I found no enjoyment in accounting. [Enter Coding] My roommate in college was a computer science major and always encouraged me to learn more about coding. Once I had told him about being unfulfilled with my career he encouraged me to check out some coding bootcamps. I looked into it and the rest is history. <br />
                    <br />
                    Through my studies at Vanderbiltâ€™s coding bootcamp I have learned how to build full stack applications and some of the principles that those applications are built on. I have built various projects that display my knowledge in the different parts of the stack. These projects can be viewed below.
